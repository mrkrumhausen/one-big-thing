# one-big-thing
Keeps you focused on your biggest task every day

### Priority, not priorities
A smart guy named Greg McKeown wrote a book called Essentialism that has a quote that really resonates with me:

The word priority came into the English language in the 1400s. It was singular. It meant the very first or prior thing. It stayed singular for the next five hundred years. Only in the 1900s did we pluralize the term and start talking about priorities. Illogically, we reasoned that by changing the word we could bend reality.
Yeah! We should really only have ONE big priority. That makes sense and itâ€™s why I really like having to prioritize my one big thing each morning.

### What does the app do?
Every day, you type in one big thing you want to do.
